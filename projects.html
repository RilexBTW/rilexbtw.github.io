									<h2>HuePy</h2>
									<p>Hue Py is a tool I created in python after noticing some strange HTTP traffic on my network, after further inspection I noticed that it was coming from my phillips hue Bridge that my smart lights used to connect to the internet (Ah, yes. we love IoT devices). After even further inspection I noticed that the http packets that were being sent from the bridge contained JSON files that had a suprising amount of data in them. Specifically, device names that had connected to the Hue Bridge, the applications the devices used to connect (The Phillips Hue app or any other third party app), and the dates the devices and apps were last and first used. As far as the actual usefulness of the information, well I don't think its neccesarily anything groundbreaking, but I am a nerd... and I like data. So I decided to create a python script that would send out get requests to the Hue Bridges and capture all of that juicy data. Unfortunately at the moment that function is in a working state. So I decided to add an additional functionality, the abilitty to control the lights, as long as you are able to press the button on the bridge to authenticate the script with the bridge.</p>

								<h2>MannyBot2.0</h2>
								<p>MannyBot2.0 is the second version of the custom discord bot I coded using the Discord.Py library in python. I started working on mannybot2.0 after my friend decided to prank me by changing his discord profile picture to an old picture of me. I Responded by working on a discord bot that would respond to him whenever he sent a chat in my discord server as revenge for pranking me. </p>
